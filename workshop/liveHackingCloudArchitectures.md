### Live Hacking Cloud Architectures

As more organizations are moving to the cloud, cloud architectures are getting more sophisticated by having a kind of technology diversity. This includes for example container orchestrators, database services, event meshes, networking components and virtual machines.

When it comes to security, observability on this diversity is paramount.
The main question here is, do you really perceive when your app landscape is under attack?

In this workshop, you will have the opportunity to execute various attack vectors and implement ways to mitigate and observe them. Many technologies will be used such as Kubernetes, eBPF, Cillium, Falco and much more!

You will not only learn how to place proper technologies in a hands-on environment but also have the opportunity to attack other participants environments!
The environment is based on a real-world cloud architecture, being compromised by scanning web applications and lateral movement with the goal of exfiltrating data.
All technologies and documentations are open source and can be utilized in your digital realm afterwards.

The only things you need to attend: modern web browser, stable internet connection, patience and curiosity.
