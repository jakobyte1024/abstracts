# Sovereignty Through Observability – Dynatrace on STACKIT, Managed by CGI

A sovereign observability service for industries that require trust and control

Sovereign IT requires transparency, control, and independent decision-making: observability is a key enabler for all three. 
As observability experts, we rely on proven platforms such as Dynatrace. 
To meet growing sovereignty requirements, we operate Dynatrace as a managed service on the EU sovereign STACKIT cloud and offer it via the STACKIT Marketplace.

We share our motivation and lessons learned from introducing SRE practices to operate and optimize Dynatrace on STACKIT at scale and paving the way for additional CGI managed services on the STACKIT platform.
