## Abstract EN
### Live Hacking Cloud Architectures

As more organizations are moving to the cloud, cloud architectures are getting more sophisticated by having a kind of technology diversity. This includes for example container orchestrators, database services, event meshes, networking components and virtual machines.

When it comes to security, observability on this diversity is paramount.
The main question here is, do you really perceive when your app landscape is under attack?

In this session, you will have the opportunity to see various attack vectors and ways to mitigate and observe them. Many technologies will be used such as Kubernetes, eBPF, Cillium, Falco and much more!

Come and watch a live attack on a real-world based cloud architecture and see the attacker scan web applications and start lateral movement with the goal of exfiltrating data.
Furthermore, become a part of the blue-team, defending and securing the architecture with modern open source tools.

## Benefits to the Ecosystem

We are very happy to show audiences what we learnt and experienced in our customer projects. Not only for well-known security vulnerabilities like Log4Shell, but also to show what various client domains are facing in real world projects.

It is very important for us to stay as vendor independent consultants. So we love to enroll open source software in cloud architectures while we also shift mindset into DevSecOps and observability focus.

Please feel free to contact us if there is any focus we can work into this presentation for the audience. We're happy to do so.
