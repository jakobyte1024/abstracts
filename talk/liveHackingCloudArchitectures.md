Cloud architectures often consist out of various technologies.
Container orchestrators, database services, networking components, virtual machines - kind of technology diversity.
When it comes to security, observability on this diversity is paramount.
Do you perceive when your app landscape is under attack ?

Watch a live attack on a an real-world based cloud architecture.
See the attacker scanning webapplications and start lateral movement with the goal to exfiltrate data.
Further, become a part of the blue-team, defending and securing the architecture with modern open sourc tools.

In this demo you will see various attack vectors and ways to mitigate and observe them.
Kubernetes, eBPF, Cillium and Falco - just to name a few used technologies.
